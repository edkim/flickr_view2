# Flickr View

This is a re-write of a project I wrote a couple of months ago. [FlickrView](https://github.com/edkim/flickr_view)

Requirements
- A new user signs up using email and password. Email should be unique. Email validity and password confirmation are checked.
- User can login using email, password
- Each time user logs in the app greets the user and shows top 10 "interesting" flickr photos
- Each photo is a link clickable to flickr site for the photo
